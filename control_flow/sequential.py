# In the above code, You can see that thing are executing in the sequential manner(Line by Line)
# But Sometime we need to make decision based on the condition in real life or in other words I can say that 
# we have to controls the things to manage the situation
# Just simailar to that, In progamming we have to make the decisions based on the conditions and execute the code 
# accoding to the condition, which is called control flow in programming world.

# In Python, there are three types of control flow:
    # 1. Making decisions: make decision based on conditions
    # 2. Repeating Actions: Repeate the task upto a specified condition is met.
    # 3. Jumping to different parts of the program
