# Rules for naming the python variables:-

# Variable name can consists :
#   --> Letters
#   --> Digits
#   --> Underscores
# Variable name must start with "_" underscore or letter
# Variable name can't start with number
# Variable names are case sensitive
# Can't use Python keywords as veriable name -> if, else, while, for, def, class etc.

name = "Vipul"
print(name)
name = "Ankit"
Name = "Lalit"
print(Name)
print(name)

# print = "Light"  # not allowed
# print(name)

# Variable naming Convention
# convention means style (how to style the name or Good practice for naming the python variable names)

# Sanke case

# it is looking very messy and not readable
# usernameofInstagram = "ankit@123" 

# the following style is used in java and called camel case convention
# userNameOfInstagram = "ankit@123";

# In Pyhton use the underscore "_" to separate the word in varaible like following:
user_name_of_instagram = "ankit@123"
print(user_name_of_instagram)
