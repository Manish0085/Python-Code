# Creating Variables in Python
# Python uis a dynamicaly typed programming language which means we don't need to specify the type of variable in python 
# as we do in Java, C++ and C as they are staticaly typed programming language
# In paython: 
#       x = 5
#       name = "Rakesh Metha"
# In java, c++: 
#       int x = 5;
#       String name = "Rakesh Metha";
# In Python, A variable is just like a box with a label on it
# Foue things about variable suppose to know,
#   1. variable name
#   2. value of the variable
#   3. type of the data stored in the variable
#   4. memory location

x = 1
name = "Ankit"
price = 999.99
is_adult = True
print(type(x), ": ", x, "; ", type(name), ": ", name, "; ", type(price), ": ", price, "; ", type(is_adult), ": ", is_adult)
